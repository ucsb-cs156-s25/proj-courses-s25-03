This repo contains the code for the CMPSC 156 legacy code project "Courses Search". 

The project provides a web application where users can search for UCSB courses in various ways.

Users with a Google Account can also store past, current or future schedules of courses for particular quarters. 

# Deployments

| Type | Link       |

| prod | <https://courses.dokku-00.cs.ucsb.edu/> | 
| qa | <https://courses-qa.dokku-00.cs.ucsb.edu/>  | 


# Setup before running application

Before running the application for the first time,
you need to do the steps documented in [`docs/oauth.md`](docs/oauth.md).

Otherwise, when you try to login for the first time, you 
will likely see an error such as:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/149858436-c9baa238-a4f7-4c52-b995-0ed8bee97487.png" alt="Authorization Error; Error 401: invalid_client; The OAuth client was not found." width="400"/>

You will also need a value for `UCSB_API_KEY`; you can obtain a value for that by following the instructions at this link: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/apis/apis_ucsb_developer_api.html>

# Getting Started on localhost

* Open *two separate terminal windows*  
* In the first window, start up the backend with:
  ``` 
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
* In the second window:
  ```
  cd frontend
  npm install  # only on first run or when dependencies change
  npm start
  ```

Then, the app should be available on <http://localhost:8080>

If it doesn't work at first, e.g. you have a blank page on  <http://localhost:8080>, give it a minute and a few page refreshes.  Sometimes it takes a moment for everything to settle in.

If you see the following on localhost, make sure that you also have the frontend code running in a separate window.

```
Failed to connect to the frontend server... On Dokku, be sure that PRODUCTION is defined.  On localhost, open a second terminal window, cd into frontend and type: npm install; npm start";
```

# Getting Started on Dokku

On Heroku, you'll need to set the following configuration variable:

* Using the Dokku CLI:
  ```
  dokku config:set <dokku app name> PRODUCTION=true
  ```

You'll also need to follow the OAuth set up instructions here: [`docs/oauth.md`](docs/oauth.md).

If you get the following message on Dokku, it probably means that you failed to setup the `PRODUCTION` environment variable.

```
Failed to connect to the frontend server... On Dokku, be sure that PRODUCTION is defined.  On localhost, open a second terminal window, cd into frontend and type: npm install; npm start";
```

Additional environment variables that are needed may be found in `.env.SAMPLE` 

In particular, you will need a value for the `UCSB_API_KEY`.  This is documented in `docs/ucsb_api_key.md`

# Accessing swagger

To access the swagger API endpoints, use:

* <http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html>


# To run React Storybook

* cd into frontend
* use: npm run storybook
* This should put the storybook on http://localhost:6006
* Additional stories are added under frontend/src/stories

* For documentation on React Storybook, see: https://storybook.js.org/

# Accessing Database Console

* On localhost only: <http://localhost:8080/h2-console>  See also: [docs/h2-console.md](docs/h2-console.md)
* On Dokku: see: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/topics/dokku/postgres_command_line.html>

## Partial pitest runs

This repo has support for partial pitest runs

For example, to run pitest on just one class, use:

```
mvn pitest:mutationCoverage -DtargetClasses=edu.ucsb.cs156.courses.controllers.PSCourseController
```

To run pitest on just one package, use:

```
mvn pitest:mutationCoverage -DtargetClasses=edu.ucsb.cs156.courses.controllers.\*
```

To run full mutation test coverage, as usual, use:

```
mvn pitest:mutationCoverage
```
